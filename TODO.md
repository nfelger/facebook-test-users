* Write README
* I want to get username/password combos
  - Problem: for FBC you really need a username/password combo to log in as the test user. FB's calls only return this on the request that creates the user. Need to see if there's a way to get user/pw post-fact.
  - If ^^ is not possible, persist user/pass after creation and show in user list.
* I don't want to mentally parse raw JSON.
* I want to delete users when I don't need them anymore.
* I want to register my apps (maybe bar secret?) on a website, so I don't have to install this thing.
